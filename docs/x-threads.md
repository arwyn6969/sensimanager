# SWOS420 Viral X Threads 🧵

Ready-to-post threads for X/Twitter launch campaign. Each includes a 15-second video concept.

## Thread 1: "We put the entire transfer market on-chain" 🔗⚽

**Video concept**: Screen-record the Transfer Market page — show a listing appearing, a bid being placed, the release clause triggering, and the NFT transferring. Speed up to 15s with dramatic zoom.

**1/7** 🧵

We just put the entire football transfer market on-chain.

Sealed-bid auctions. Release clauses. Loan deals.

Every transfer burns 5% of $SENSI forever.

Welcome to @SWOS420 on Base. 🏟️

---

**2/7**

Here's how it works:

→ List your player NFT with a minimum bid
→ Set a release clause (auto-accept price)
→ 3-day bidding window opens
→ Highest bidder wins

No agents. No middlemen. Just code.

---

**3/7**

The secret sauce? Deflationary economics.

Every transfer:
• 5% of the fee → burned forever 🔥
• 5% → treasury (development fund)
• 90% → seller

The more you trade, the scarcer $SENSI becomes.

But these aren't just JPEGs.

Each player NFT stores 7 immutable base skills:
PA · VE · HE · TA · CO · SP · FI

Plus dynamic stats that change every matchday:
• Form (-100 to +100)
• Market value (recalculated on-chain)
• Season goals

Your NFT literally gets better when your player scores.

The loan system is live too.

Loan a player to another manager:
→ Set duration + fee
→ Player custody transfers temporarily
→ Recall after expiry

Loan an Mbappé-tier NFT for a cup run. Return him after. All on-chain.

---

**6/7**

The match engine runs 24/7.

AI managers compete autonomously.
Results push to chain via oracle.
Wages paid in $SENSI every matchday.
Form updates change your NFT's value in real-time.

This isn't a game. It's a parallel football economy.

Built by @Grok420 for the anon football degens who remember SWOS.

$SENSI is the currency. NFTs are the players. The pitch is on Base.

## Thread 2: "Your NFT just scored a hat-trick" ⚽🎯

**Video concept**: Record the NFT Gallery page. Focus on a single PlayerCard — show the form bar animating from negative to positive, goals incrementing, and the value display updating. Overlay "GOAL! GOAL! GOAL!" text at 15fps retro style.

---

**1/6** 🧵

Your NFT just scored a hat-trick.

Its form jumped +30.
Its market value increased 47%.
You earned 300 $SENSI in match wages.

This all happened automatically. While you slept.

Welcome to @SWOS420 — the most dynamic NFTs in crypto. ⚽

---

**2/6**

Every SWOS player NFT stores 7 base skills from the OG Sensible World of Soccer:

🎯 Passing — PA
⚡ Velocity — VE
🗣️ Heading — HE
🦶 Tackling — TA
🎮 Control — CO
💨 Speed — SP
🔥 Finishing — FI

These are immutable. Set at mint. Never change.

---

**3/6**

But the DYNAMIC stats? Those change every single matchday.

📊 Form: -100 to +100, based on performance
💰 Value: recalculated on-chain (form × goals × age)
⚽ Goals: season + all-time tracking

Effective skill = base × (100 + form) / 100

A player in hot form LITERALLY becomes better.

---

**4/6**

Here's the value formula (runs on-chain, verified):

```
value = base × form_mod × goal_bonus × age_factor
```

Young striker scoring goals? 📈📈📈
30+ midfielder in bad form? 📉

Just like real football. Except it's all trustless.

## Thread 3: "The $SENSI economy burns" 🔥💎

**Video concept**: Dashboard page showing the $SENSI Total Supply stat counter. Simulate a matchday settlement — show the "Burned" stat ticking upward in real-time while supply drops. Add fire emoji overlays.

---

**1/8** 🧵

$SENSI has a problem.

It keeps burning itself. 🔥

Every wage payment. Every transfer. Every matchday.

5% gone. Forever.

And we're just getting started. Here's the full SWOS420 economy:

---

**2/8**

The supply starts at 1 BILLION $SENSI.

But it's designed to shrink.

Every matchday, wages are distributed to NFT owner wallets.
Of every wage payment:
• 90% → NFT owner
• 5% → burned 🔥
• 5% → treasury

Owning players = passive $SENSI income.

---

**3/8**

Transfers accelerate the burn.

When a player NFT sells on the on-chain market:
• 10% total fee
  → 5% burned forever 🔥
  → 5% to treasury

Active transfer windows = major deflationary events.

The best teams trade the most. The token gets scarcer.

---

**4/8**

Season bonuses inject $SENSI — but strategically.

🏆 League Champion: 100,000 $SENSI
⚽ Top Scorer Owner: 10,000 $SENSI
🧤 Clean Sheet bonus: 500 $SENSI per match

These mint NEW tokens — but getting them requires winning.

Winning = compounding. Losing = fading.

---

**5/8**

League multipliers create a tiered economy:

• Premier League: 1.8x wages
• La Liga: 1.5x
• Bundesliga / Serie A: 1.3x
• Ligue 1: 1.2x

Premier League NFTs earn 80% more $SENSI per matchday.

Promotion = payday. Relegation = pain.

---

**6/8**

The wage formula (from rules.json, verified on-chain):

```
weekly_wage = value × 0.0018 × league_multiplier
```

A 10M-value Premier League player earns:
10,000,000 × 0.0018 × 1.8 = 32,400 $SENSI/week

Of which 90% (29,160) goes to YOU as the NFT owner.

---

**7/8**

This creates a flywheel:

1. Own high-value NFTs → earn $SENSI wages
2. Use $SENSI to bid on better players
3. Better players → more wins → form boost → value increase
4. Higher value → higher wages → more $SENSI
5. Every step burns 5% → token gets scarcer

It's a perpetual motion machine for degens. ⚽🔄

---

**8/8**
