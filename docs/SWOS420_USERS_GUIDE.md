## Philosophy

The blockchain is your **irrevocable proof of ownership**.  
The Python engine (40+ modules, 4,500+ lines) is the **living game**.  
Own players as NFTs → they appear in your career save with special perks.  
Rent hoarding slots → your brand appears on the 24/7 stream pitch.

## 1. Getting Started (5 minutes)

1. **Install MetaMask** → add Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532, RPC: `https://sepolia.base.org`)
2. **Get testnet ETH** from [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet)
3. **Run locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arwyn6969/sensimanager.git && cd sensimanager
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
```

## 2. Ownership Workflow

### Mint / Claim Player NFTs

```bash
python scripts/mint_from_db.py --to YOUR_WALLET --club "Tranmere Rovers"
python scripts/arweave/generate_cards.py --from-json data/players_export.json --club "Tranmere Rovers"
```

Each NFT has an Arweave SVG card with stats, club badge, and position. Arwyn Hughes gets a special SWA Academy Graduate badge + Welsh dragon 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿.

### Sync to Career Mode

Owned NFTs auto-load into your squad via `db/repository.py`. **Owner perks:**

| Perk | Description |

| 💰 Wage share | 10% weekly wages in $SENSI |
| 📈 Form boost | +2 form as "manager owner" |

### Arwyn Hughes Special Rule

If you own the **Arwyn Hughes** NFT, he starts with +15 hidden potential and auto-promotes to first team after 5 goals.

```bash
python scripts/add_arwyn_hughes.py --db    # Add to database
python scripts/add_arwyn_hughes.py --show  # View player card
```

| Attribute | Value |

## 3. Trading & Transfer Market

### Hybrid Sealed-Bid System

**Off-chain (Python):**

```bash
python scripts/transfer_market.py --window summer --team "Tranmere Rovers"
```

Sealed bids, budget validation, release clauses, free agents — 347 lines of pure logic.

**On-chain (real ownership):**

1. Approve $SENSI on `TransferMarket.sol`
2. Place sealed bid via dashboard
3. Window closes → contract resolves highest bid, transfers NFT + $SENSI
4. Engine syncs: `python scripts/sync_onchain.py`

**Revenue:** Buyer pays $SENSI → 5% platform fee → 95% to seller.

### Scouting (4 Tiers)

| Tier | Cost | Reveals |
|------|------|---------|
| None | Free | Name, Position, Age |
| Basic | £50K | 3 skills (±1 noise) |
| Detailed | £150K | All skills + potential |
| Full | £500K | Everything (exact) |
